          "Choose you. In any relationship, you must take care of yourself even in a marriage. It's important to communicate your needs of self-care to your partner and vice versa. If you are in a relationship that isn't defined as committed or in a long-term committed relationship, this person should be working for you not against you. It's also about respect, having healthy boundaries and working well together. As hard as it can be at times, do not be afraid to shwo your partner who you are. Love is love. Ans if it's love it won't change the relationship. If it's working against you, be strong enough and have enough self-respect to walk away."
