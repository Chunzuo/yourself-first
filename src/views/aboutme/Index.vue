            With the chaos that life can bring, it’s easy to forget about making
            yourself and your needs the priority. But this year it’s all about
            you! My approach: I’m a collective taking an array of different
            therapeutic approaches, and theories, (solution focused therapy,
            CBT, DBT, Trauma-focused CBT, Mindfulness techniques, Internal
            Family Systems, Gestalt theory, the law of attraction, sex specific
            treatment, relate model, client centered/ strengths perspective,
            feedback informed treatment) and tools to incorporate when
            appropriate in session to best fit my clients’ needs to achieve the
            best outcome for wellness.

            I’m psychodynamic and believe therapy should always be interactive
            as you should always be getting something out of each session. I
            also believe to track treatment progress weekly to avoid feeling
            “stuck” and for better treatment outcomes. I believe therapy with me
            is always a positive, safe, supportive, and validating environment
            that allows you to grow emotionally and personally. I also emphasize
            on self-love and self-confidence to enrich the quality of my
            clients’ lives to promote balance, find the beauty and power within
            themselves to optimize the best results towards their therapeutic
            journey. I also make it a point to be real, genuine, honest and
            transparent with my engagement and interactive feedback to my
            clients because I always have their best interest at heart. I find
            it really important to get to know my clients and their stories to
            better serve their needs. I also encourage my clients to be gentle
            with themselves and self-aware of the internal dialogue they have in
            their head as well as challenging their thought process to further
            launch them forward. It comes naturally to me to go above and beyond
            for my clients to provide them with other resources they may need
            such as legal, psychiatrist, IOP, etc. I also encourage my clients
            to give feedback on each session to let me know how they think
            they’re doing for continuous progress. I am also big on
            manifestations, affirmations and the power of envisioning techniques
            to give my clients the life/ lifestyle they want for themselves. I
            understand my approach and style may not work for everyone which is
            okay! What’s important is meeting your needs and finding a therapist
            that’s the right fit for you. I can gladly refer you to a colleague
            if necessary. I look forward to working with you!
