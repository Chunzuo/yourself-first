I’m an intellect and researching the latest clinical approaches and outcomes for success is my forte. This will allow them to be the best version of themselves and have a life that’s fulfilling and meaningful. I look forward to working with my clients to come up with concrete tangible goals and objectives to achieve their idea of overall wellness in all life domains. I’m passionate about what I do, and although I should stick to 45 minutes, sometimes I get so invested in my clients I loose track of time. I love the process and love a solution focused approach but know that approach isn’t for everyone and I adjust accordingly.My office is known for being “cozy” so I hope we get a chance to meet!</p>
